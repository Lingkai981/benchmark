1. void send_message(const KeyT& id, const MessageT& msg)
Description: This function is used to send a message to a vertex identified by id.

Parameters:

id: The ID of the target vertex.
msg: The message to be sent.
Example Usage:

send_message(neighbor_id, some_message);
In the Provided Code:

bcast_to_in_nbs(VertexID msg) and bcast_to_out_nbs(VertexID msg) use send_message to broadcast messages to all incoming and outgoing neighbors, respectively.
2. void vote_to_halt()
Description: This function is used to indicate that the current vertex has finished its computation and can be halted until it receives new messages.

Example Usage:

vote_to_halt();
In the Provided Code:

Used at the end of the compute function to halt the vertex after processing messages.
3. inline ValueT& value()
Description: This function returns a reference to the value stored in the vertex.

Example Usage:

OWCTYValue_scc &val = value();
In the Provided Code:

Used to access and modify the vertex's value in compute.
4. inline int step_num()
Description: Returns the current superstep number.

Example Usage:

if(step_num() == 1) {
    // do something in the first step
}
In the Provided Code:

Used in the compute function to check the current superstep and execute specific logic based on it.
5. virtual VertexT* toVertex(char* line)
Description: This pure virtual function converts a line from the input file into a vertex.

Parameters:

line: A line of input representing a vertex.
Example Usage:


virtual OWCTYVertex_scc* toVertex(char* line) {
    // Implementation to convert line to OWCTYVertex_scc object
}
In the Provided Code:

Implemented in the OWCTYWorker_scc class to parse the input file and create vertex objects.
6. virtual void toline(VertexT* v, BufferedWriter& writer)
Description: This pure virtual function converts a vertex into a line for the output file.

Parameters:

v: The vertex to be converted.
writer: The writer object used to write the output.
Example Usage:

virtual void toline(OWCTYVertex_scc* v, BufferedWriter & writer) {
    // Implementation to convert OWCTYVertex_scc object to line and write
}
In the Provided Code:

Implemented in the OWCTYWorker_scc class to serialize vertex objects into the output format.
