Analysis of Core API Functions Used in the Code
1. GraphLoader.edgeListFile
Description: Loads a graph from an edge list file. Each line in the file should contain two vertex IDs representing an edge.
Parameters:

sc: SparkContext – The Spark context to use for loading the data.
path: String – The path to the edge list file.
Example Usage:

val graph = GraphLoader.edgeListFile(sc, "data/test/followers.txt")
This function reads the edges of a graph from a file and creates a graph from these edges.

2. graph.connectedComponents
Description: Computes the connected components of the graph. Each connected component is labeled with the ID of its lowest-numbered vertex.
Parameters: None (it is called on a Graph object).

Example Usage:

val cc = graph.connectedComponents().vertices
This function finds all connected components in the graph and returns a VertexRDD containing pairs of vertex IDs and component IDs.

3. RDD.join
Description: Performs an inner join of two RDDs based on their keys.
Parameters:

other: RDD[(K, V)] – The RDD to join with.
partitioner: Partitioner (optional) – A partitioner to use for the resulting RDD.
Example Usage:

val users = sc.textFile("data/test/users.txt").map { line =>
  val fields = line.split(",")
  (fields(0).toLong, fields(1))
}
val ccByUsername = users.join(cc).map {
  case (id, (username, cc)) => (username, cc)
}
The join function is used here to join the connected components RDD with the usernames RDD on their vertex IDs.

Detailed Information on the API Functions
1. GraphLoader.edgeListFile
Function: GraphLoader.edgeListFile(sc: SparkContext, path: String): Graph[Int, Int]

sc: The Spark context required to read the file.
path: The file path of the edge list.
Returns: A Graph where both vertices and edges have integer attributes.
Usage:

Used to load a graph from an edge list file.
2. connectedComponents
Function: def connectedComponents(): Graph[VertexId, ED]

Returns: A Graph where each vertex attribute is the ID of the component it belongs to.
Usage:

Used to find connected components in a graph.
3. RDD.join
Function: def join[W](other: RDD[(K, W)]): RDD[(K, (V, W))]

other: Another RDD to join with.
Returns: An RDD containing all pairs of elements with matching keys in both RDDs.
Usage:

Joins two RDDs based on their keys.

     }
   - return users

4: function JOIN_USERS_WITH_COMPONENTS(users, cc):
   - ccByUsername = users.join(cc).map {
       case (id, (username, cc)) => (username, cc)
     }
   - return ccByUsername

5: function PRINT_RESULTS(ccByUsername):
   - println(ccByUsername.collect().mkString("\n"))

6: main function:
   - spark = SparkSession.builder().appName("ConnectedComponentsExample").getOrCreate()
